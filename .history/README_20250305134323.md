# Extension-Dice

## How to install

Install via the built-in "Download Extensions and Assets" tool. Or use a direct link:

```txt
https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-Dice
```

## How to use

### Via the function tool

Requires a comptabile Chat Completion backend. See [Function Calling](https://docs.sillytavern.app/for-contributors/function-calling/) for more information.

To roll the dice, just ask for it. For example:

```txt
Roll a d20
```

### Via the wand menu

A set of 7 classic D&amp;D dice for all your dice rolling needs. Dice rolls are just for show and are not visible in AI prompts.

1. Open the wand menu.
2. Click on the "Roll Dice" item.
3. Select the dice you want to roll, or `...` if you want to roll a custom dice.

### Via slash commands

You can use the `/roll` or `/r` slash command to roll dice directly in the chat:

```txt
/roll 2d6       # Roll two 6-sided dice
/r 1d20+5       # Short alias for roll command
/roll 3d8 quiet:true  # Roll dice without displaying in chat
```

### Via macros

You can use the `{{roll}}` macro in your messages to automatically roll dice:

```txt
I roll {{roll: 2d6}} on my attack.
The damage is {{roll:3d8+5}} points.
```

If you provide just a number, it will be treated as a die with that many sides:
```txt
I roll a {{roll:20}} for my attack.  # Equivalent to {{roll:1d20}}
```
