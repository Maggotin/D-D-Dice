# Extension-Dice

A comprehensive dice rolling extension for SillyTavern with support for standard and advanced dice notation.

## How to install

Install via the built-in "Download Extensions and Assets" tool. Or use a direct link:

```txt
https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-Dice
```

## How to use

### Via the function tool

Requires a comptabile Chat Completion backend. See [Function Calling](https://docs.sillytavern.app/for-contributors/function-calling/) for more information.

To roll the dice, just ask for it. For example:

```txt
Roll a d20
Roll 4d6 and keep the highest 3
Roll a d20 and reroll any 1s
```

### Via the wand menu

A set of 7 classic D&amp;D dice for all your dice rolling needs. Dice rolls are just for show and are not visible in AI prompts.

1. Open the wand menu.
2. Click on the "Roll Dice" item.
3. Select the dice you want to roll, or `...` if you want to roll a custom dice.

### Via slash commands

You can use the `/roll` or `/r` slash command to roll dice directly in the chat:

```txt
/roll 2d6       # Roll two 6-sided dice
/r 1d20+5       # Short alias for roll command
/roll 3d8 quiet:true  # Roll dice without displaying in chat
```

### Via macros

You can use the `{{roll}}` macro in your messages to automatically roll dice:

```txt
I roll {{roll: 2d6}} on my attack.
The damage is {{roll:3d8+5}} points.
```

If you provide just a number, it will be treated as a die with that many sides:
```txt
I roll a {{roll:20}} for my attack.  # Equivalent to {{roll:1d20}}
```

All dice rolls using macros will be displayed in the chat with detailed information about the roll.

## Advanced Dice Notation

This extension supports advanced dice notation similar to Roll20:

### Basic Notation

```
NdS
```

Where:
- `N` is the number of dice to roll (optional, defaults to 1 if omitted)
- `d` is the delimiter indicating a die roll
- `S` is the number of sides on each die

### Modifiers

```
NdS+M   # Add modifier M to the result
NdS-M   # Subtract modifier M from the result
```

### Keep/Drop Dice

```
NdSkH   # Keep highest H dice
NdSkL   # Keep lowest L dice
NdSdH   # Drop highest H dice
NdSdL   # Drop lowest L dice
```

Examples:
- `4d6k3` - Roll 4d6 and keep the highest 3 (common for D&D ability scores)
- `2d20kh1` - Roll 2d20 and keep the highest (advantage in D&D 5e)
- `2d20kl1` - Roll 2d20 and keep the lowest (disadvantage in D&D 5e)

### Rerolling Dice

```
NdSr<X   # Reroll once if less than X
NdSr>X   # Reroll once if greater than X
NdSrr<X  # Reroll repeatedly if less than X
NdSrr>X  # Reroll repeatedly if greater than X
```

Examples:
- `1d20r<2` - Roll 1d20 and reroll once if the result is 1
- `3d6r<3` - Roll 3d6 and reroll any 1s or 2s once

### Exploding Dice

```
NdS!   # Explode dice (roll an additional die for each maximum value)
```

Examples:
- `3d6!` - Roll 3d6, and for each 6, roll an additional d6

### Combining Modifiers

You can combine these modifiers:

```
4d6k3+2        # Roll 4d6, keep highest 3, add 2
2d20r<2kh1     # Roll 2d20, reroll 1s, keep highest (super advantage)
3d6!+1d8       # Roll 3d6 with explosions, plus 1d8
```

## Detailed Roll Information

When using advanced dice notation, the extension will display detailed information about the roll:

- For keep/drop modifiers: Shows which dice were kept and which were dropped
- For reroll modifiers: Shows which dice were rerolled
- For exploding dice: Shows which dice exploded

This helps players understand exactly how the final result was calculated.
