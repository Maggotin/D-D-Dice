# Current Implementation

## Working Features
- Basic dice rolling (d4-d100)
- UI button and dropdown
- Simple and complex macro support
- Function calling integration
- Slash commands (/roll, /r)
- Security enhancements with SRI

## Security Improvements
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN scripts
- Input validation (max formula length: 100 chars)
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Version pinning for dependencies

## Current State
- Implemented security enhancements for external libraries
- Added SRI verification for CDN scripts
- Improved input validation
- Updated documentation
- Resolved MIME type issues with local files by using CDN with SRI

## Next Steps
1. Test security enhancements with various scenarios
2. Consider additional input validation for potentially dangerous patterns
3. Implement timeout mechanism for complex dice calculations
4. Update documentation with security best practices
5. Consider adding user-configurable security options
